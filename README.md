## Getting Started

### Linting/formatting

Linting/formatting should be done on save if you have the Prettier VS code extension installed. However it can be ran manually by running `npm run lint`. This command will format all the files in the repo.

## IDE Setup

### VS Code (Recommended)

If you use VS Code, you're in luck because all the important project specific settings are already configured for you.

1. Press `ctrl + P` or `cmd + P` to bring up the action list.
2. Start typing `extensions` and select `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions`.
3. Install all recommended extensions.

### Other code editors or IDEs

Install and configure extensions for the following:

- `typescript`
- `prettier`
- Linter: `eslint`
